This code is done for my school assignment for the module data structure and algorithm. 
This code utilizes mainly on python. 
The assignment is to create an employment system which can view, add, sort department using bubble sort, sort salary using selection sort. 
I added extra features such as simulating user logging in to add an employee, simulated the logs and added some aesthetics into the output when displaying the data.
